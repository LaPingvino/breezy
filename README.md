# Breezy
Breezy is a lightweight CMS that uses markdown to write blog posts.

The webserver is written in Go and the data is stored in a MongoDB database.

Breezy focuses on a simply one column flowing blog style. This is so the content is the center of attention for the creator and viewers of the blog.

## Features
#### Markdown
The Editor in Breezy is built to handle Markdown syntax in a minimalist way. The user can just type it all out or drag and drop elements in from the side panels of the editor.

#### Backup and Export
Breezy allows you to manually backup your posts or setup up a scheduled backup system. Users can also easily export their data from the database to store or do whatever they wish.

#### Media Library
Breezy also presents a library to store images, video, and audio files to present to users on the blog or other websites.
